## Certificate Requirements ## {#certificate-requirements}

Note: this section must be carefully inspected

The immunity certificate must contain the following info:

```
<certification id>
<test id>
<manifacturer id>
<lot id>
<entity's id that submitted the test>
<DB url where test data are stored>
<Sanitary Personnel id, who submitted the test>
<test timestamp>
<test type (PCR, IGG, IGM)>
<test outcome>
<Identity document number>
<Identity document type>
<Identity document issuer>
```

Issue: if it is an immunity certification, the test outcome MUST be positive (has the antibodies), therefore this field is redundant.

When a user wants to prove his/her immunity has to show a QRcode that contains these information

```
<DB url where test data are stored>
<test type (PCR, IGG, IGM)>
<test outcome>
<Identity document number>
<Identity document type>
```
