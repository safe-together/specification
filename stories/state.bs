# User state  #  {#user-state-machine}

There are four **core user state** that **MUST** be considered inside SafeTogether application : 

: U (unknown)
:: the state *Unknown* says that the system knows nothing about citizen health status. 
: Q (quarantined)
:: the state *Quarantined* (at home) means that the outcome of a swab test was positive, and the citizen is now quarantined. 
: S (suspended)
:: if the citizen is hospitalized, the quarantine *Suspended*
: I (immune)
:: when the patient is not hill and antybodies test are positive (i.e. he/she recovers from Covid-19) becomes *Immune*

This diagram summarizes the state transition diagram for a citizen can go through while part of the SafeTogether system.

 **application state:**

SafeTogether applications **MAY** introduce some additional  *application state*  as generalization or as specialization of the four *core* user state, for example :

- a SafeTogether application **MAY** consider the additional  state *positive* (P)  defined as  the union of *quarantined* and *suspended* state.
- some SafeTogether stories MAY consider the additional state *pending* (D)  to qualify the  "Unknown" state after the execution of a medical test but before
    the test result. For SafeTogether purposes the *Pending* virtual state **MUST** be considered equivalent to the *Unknown* state.

This diagram shows an example of a more complex design of *application state* that can be assumed in some stories about volunteers:

In previous diagram *Volunteer* can be defined as a specialization of the *Immune* state, *Autenticated* a specialization of "*Volunteer* and *Fraudolent* a specialization of *Autenticated* 

# Privacy and rights requirements # {#user-privacy}

: Citizens **MUST** have *view only* rights on their state
:: citizens can view their status but they are not allowed to change it.
: Institutional Forces (Police, etc) – **MAY** have *view only* rights citizen's state
:: Policeman who needs to check circulation rights and citizen status to regulate and enforce government directives. 	
: Sanitary Personnel (Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses, etc) – *MAY** have view and edit right
:: Sanitary Personnel is the only person who can digitally sign the report on the patient's state of health.
:: In the case of immunities, he is the only person who can decide the period of validity and its revocation.
:: Citizens that have recovered, are immune and want to help during the crisis.
: Immune volunteers **MUST* authenticate
:: they **MUST** be digitally identified to be part of a Shielding program. They **SHOULD** provide geographic position when operates for the program.
:: they **MUST**  provide to authorized people their immunity credentials in order to accept a Shielding task.
:: like  other citizen they  have *view only* rights
: Legally quarantined people **MUST* authenticate
:: they **MUST** provide a strong biometric authentication to quarantine system and They **MUST** provide to the aothority  their geographic position.
